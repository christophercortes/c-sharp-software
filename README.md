# Overview

This program will demonstrate the basic development project with dotnet using C#. This project uses Visual Studio Code to write the program and GitHub for production.


The purpose of the software is to store data for a library. It will display the genre and book collection provided by the system.
It will interact with users to provide an ID account number and store their history with loans and returns books. The software also prevents errors that it may encounter due to wrong inputs from users.

This software has the purpose of simply understanding the initialization of a program and its features using dotnet and the files required to write code.

# Development Environment

The software gets features from dotnet and it is written using C#. It is developed with the Visual Studio Code editing code software and for production Github. 

C# is a modern programming language that is object-oriented, and type-safe. It is used to develop mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud-based services, websites, enterprise and games.

# Future Work

This program is a Library Catalog System. To potentially improve the software, it can be incorporated some feautres to interact with the users and ask them for specific books avoinding displaying the whole collection. 

- The program contains classes to store a List of string
- Loop through the database
- In the future, it can incorporate code to push and pop items in the stack.
