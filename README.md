# Overview

This program will demonstrate the basic development project with dotnet using C#. This project uses Visual Studio Code to write the program and GitHub production.


The project will run a simple message saying hello world!

This software has the purpose to simply understanding the initialization of a program and its features using dotnet and the files required to write code.
